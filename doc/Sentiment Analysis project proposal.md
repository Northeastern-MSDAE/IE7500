# **Sentiment Analysis Using Open Source Dataset**

## 📌 Introduction  
With the explosion of social media platforms and online forums, vast amounts of **user-generated text data** are being created daily. **Sentiment analysis**—the task of identifying the sentiment or emotion expressed in text—has become an essential tool for organizations and researchers alike.  

This project aims to develop a **robust sentiment analysis model** using an open-source dataset to classify text into predefined sentiment categories (**positive, negative, neutral**).
